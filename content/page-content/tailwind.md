# My Story (aka My Pitch)

## My name is Brian

I'm a combat veteran with a degree in Theology, so I guess you could say that I took the traditional path into a tech career..

About four years ago, my wife, Amy, and I moved to Lancaster, PA with no money, no jobs, no college degrees, and no place to live. Not only that, but we had very little work experience to leverage in order to get some of those things.

It was extremely challenging, especially because Amy is a Canadian citizen (from Winnipeg!) and she wasn't yet legally allowed to work here in the US.

I had to step up and find a way to support us, so I did three things that I'd like to share with you, because they're the same things I do every time I face a new challenge, and they're the reason I'll be the perfect addition to your team.

### Work

The first thing I did was work. That's not a simple thing to do. Finding a decent job was really challenging. I was able to leverage my military service to get a military-specific internship at a bank where I worked for 12 weeks before ending the internship. At the end, I only had 12 weeks of banking experience, so the only department there that would hire me on full time was the call center, where folks call in to yell and complain about their fees and mortgage escrow.

That would probably actually make for a decent podcast..

### Innovate

I knew I needed some additional income, but even more than that, I needed something to work on that I was passionate about. I realized I could learn pretty quickly on YouTube how to fix phone screens and started doing that as often as possible. I was advertising everywhere I could. I met people in bookstores and gas stations and cafes. I replaced their screens on the spot and made grocery money along the way.

### Learn

I've always had a knack for bettering my own situation. Whether it's fixing something up to sell so I can get a better one of that thing, or finding a shortcut in a college class, I was always hacking.

Ever since I was 12 and read CSS: The Missing Manual cover-to-cover I've had an interest in web development, but I got discouraged as a kid and gave up trying to code after some failed attempts at making "Web 2.0" websites with dynamic content and nifty shadows.

My job was fine and the phone repairs were helping to pay the bills, but I wanted so much more out of my career, so I hit up Udemy and Team Treehouse, and Wes Bos, and learned everything I could about full-stack JavaScript.

I wanted to be a developer so bad that I was applying to every remote dev job I could find on the internet. I applied to hundreds of jobs and got rejected for every single one.

I finally found a small software company called, Ever Accountable, that offered me a part-time position as a customer supporter, and eventually I was hired full-time and I convinced my boss to let me do some additional work (beyond my 40 hours) as a front-end developer, and the rest, as they say, is history.

## Why You Should Care

My ability to change my situation has only grown over the last 4 years as a professional developer. I've gotten jobs I should have never gotten and excelled in every role I've occupied. Most recently, I was hired as a Python developer with no experience at all in Python. My "homework" project was a [Django app](https://github.com/bswank/sbpc) that the team absolutely loved. Unfortunately, I was laid off from that job after just two months because of the pandemic/shutdown.

In my next role, I'll bring every skill, experience, and piece of knowledge I've gained over the last four years to bear, but that's not why I think I'm right for your team and this role. I think I'm the right person because I will never stop working hard, innovating, and learning.

## Recent Work

I appreciate you reading my story, but I also wanted to share some very recent work with you. I've shifted gears since last Monday when I was laid off. I immediately realized that if I'm going to land another gig as great as my last couple jobs, I'm going to need more public code and writing samples. Most everything I've produced in my career has been on internal tools owned by my employers, so I didn't have much to show.

I'm proud of some of the things I've written, coded, and designed, but most importantly, as of today, May 13th, I've produced almost everything I'll share here within the last 9 days:

- [This site! (Released into the world just prior to my layoff)](https://github.com/bswank/swank.dev)
- [A blog post about my site](https://swank.dev/blog/new-website/)
- [A tutorial on adding serverless functions to a static site](https://swank.dev/blog/add-serverless-functions/)
- [A tutorial on publishing to NPM](https://swank.dev/blog/publishing-to-npm/)
- [A tutorial on deploying a Vue app to Cloudflare Workers](https://swank.dev/blog/deploy-vue-to-cloudflare-workers/)
- [A utility to reformat US currency in an input](https://www.npmjs.com/package/format-currency-input)
- [A utility to calculate percentages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/calculate-percentages)

I know this is an odd list of mostly trivial, non-code work, but I hope it showcases my ability to do whatever it takes to make the next right move in my professional life. In this case, it was producing some public content to point potential employers to.

## Conclusion

I believe I'm a whole bunch of things that make me a great fit for this role.

- I am extremely well-versed in Vue (and would love to convince you to try Gridsome or Nuxt for your docs website, but if you don't I'll happily work with Next and MDX ðŸ™ƒ).
- I love OSS and can interact well with maintainers, issue-reporters, and pull-request-makers.
- I can make technically-challenging concepts simple.
- I love writing documentation.
- I love making things for developers.
- I take criticism well and am always looking for help improving.
- I don't take myself too seriously.
- I love and enjoy writing modern JavaScript and CSS.
- I think ahead and try to make sure my actions' 2nd and 3rd order consequences will reflect well on today's work.
- I am empathetic and caring.
- I have solid communication skills.
- I have experience working remotely and on very small teams.
- I can contribute at a high level to organizational and project direction.
- I love and know good UX and UI.
- I can bring a design to life with the same finesse and love that was used to design it.
- I can extrapolate on a design and bring more to life than was originally intended.
- I have a strong attention to detail that was driven into the depths of my being over 6 years in the Army.
- I have a love for Canada.
- I have a desire to be helpful.

That last one, though â€“ that's the real cheese. I spend my free time coaching aspiring developers, working on personal finance with guys who are struggling with drug addiction, and serving refugees in my community who need a little help adjusting.

As a husband, as a developer, and as a member of my community, I always strive to be the best I can possibly be. I'm sure I won't be the most qualified or experienced candidate for this job, but I promise you I'm the one you should choose.
