# /uses

Inspired by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) and his project, [uses.tech](https://uses.tech).

## Computer & Workspace

- **Computer:** I use a 2019 16" [MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch-space-gray-2.3ghz-8-core-processor-1tb#) (i9/32GB/2TB) for everything (work + personal). The physical escape key and fixed keyboard is amazing.
- **Chair:** When I sit, I sit on an [Ikea Markus office chair](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/markus-office-chair-vissle-dark-gray-90289172/), but I stand almost 100% of the time.
- **Desk:** My desk is a [Fully Jarvis standing desk](https://www.fully.com/jarvis-frame-only.html) (which I love) with the Bamboo top (which I don't recommend). If you're looking for a great sit-stand desk, I highly recommend Jarvis. Also, purchase directly from Fully vs. Amazon. Fully's customer support is incredible.

## Peripherals

- **TB3 Hub:** I can only imagine Apple tried and failed to make a decent Thunderbolt 3 dock since that's the only reasonable explanation for getting rid of all the ports and providing no hub, so I use [a great one](https://amzn.to/3cVrQYf) from CalDigit. It handles 5K @ 60hz as well as providing 85W of power, which is a bit less than the 100w requirement, but is plenty to let me plug one single cable into my computer.
- **Monitor:** My primary display is a single 32" 4K [Dell U3219Q](https://amzn.to/3aJTo0Y), which can also be used as a USB-C dock. I used the 27" version of this monitor previously and really like them both.
- **Webcam:** It's a bit pricey, but the [Logitech Brio](https://amzn.to/2W4drlG) webcam is 4K and has some nifty options. It can make you look pretty good even a poorly-lit room.
- **Keyboard & Mouse:** I use the [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://amzn.to/2VHSYEc) and the [Logitech MX Ergo](https://amzn.to/2W1vsB3) trackball mouse.

## Audio & Recording

- **Microphone:** I use the [Rode Procaster](https://amzn.to/3cWOI9L) Dynamic Broadcast Microphone which is affixed via shock mount to a [Rode PSA 1 Boom](https://amzn.to/3aJCWht).
- **Preamp & Audio Interface:** Audio from my microphone passes through the [Cloudlifter CL-1](https://amzn.to/3eXFc7W) mic activator, which gives it a decent gain boost, and is piped into my computer via the [M-Audio 192|4](https://amzn.to/2KJBjFH) interface.
- **Headphones:** For recording and general listening, I use the [Bose QC 35 ii](https://amzn.to/3cRzx1n) and if I need to eliminate latency or monitor my mic I plug them into my audio interface. For editing, I use the [Audio-Technica ATH-M50x](https://amzn.to/2W2G2HR). I absolutely love the [coiled cable](https://amzn.to/35eGlDF) that came with the ATH-M50x, so I use that with my Bose headphones as well (and even bought a backup).
- **Studio Monitors:** I'm far from an audiophile and have no studio monitors. When I'm listening to music in my office I use my built-in MacBook Pro speakers. _gasp_

## Apps & Services

- **Editor & Terminal:** I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Hyper Terminal](https://hyper.is/) â€“ both with [Cobat2](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) theme because of its amazing contrast.
- **Password Manager:** I manage all my logins, passwords, keys, pins, account numbers, and more in [1Password](https://1password.com/).
- **Notes:** I use [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) as a brain dump. Any list or idea or thing I need to remember gets put into a Keep note. I like it because it has a great iOS app and a web app.
- **To Dos:** [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) is my to-do list app and I use it every day for work and personal projects and reminders.
