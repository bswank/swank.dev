# Hello.

## My name is Brian Swank.

I'm a developer living in Lancaster, Pennsylvania â€“ a cool little city in the heart of Amish Country. I live here with my wife, [Amy](https://instagram.com/amynswank). We also have a cat named [Moe](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/moethehousepanther/), but we're not cat parents. He has cat parents (I'm assuming). We refer to him as "Moe, the house panther" for short.

## Work & Tech

I work at [Spacebase](https://spacebaseapp.com) as a software engineer and I'm cooking up a few things on the side. (EDIT: I just got laid off from Spacebase due to effects of COVID-19 and the shutdown, so I am now looking for my next role!)

At work, I use Python & Django on AWS with PostgreSQL. When I'm not working, I write JavaScript with nifty tech like Netlify, Vue.js, AWS Lambda, and MongoDB.

## Reach Out

You can get in touch by reaching out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/briansw). I'm currently looking for a new full-time gig!
